# Repertoire Keeper

Performing music groups of all sizes and configurations desire to track the repertoire they have performed. There are several reasons to organize this information
   - Ensuring a program isn't repeated to frequently
   - Identify favorite works and those not performed as often
   - Re-create an anniversary concert
   - Simply to know what has been performed!

Repertoire Keeper grew out of many people wondering aloud over the years how to track this information. As a developer, I had added this question to those I ponder in my downtime and found an opportunity with this technology stack to try out one of those ideas.
